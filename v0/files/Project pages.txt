Link to App Store

Honeychain is a sequenced memory matching game developed for iOS using the Swift programming language, and was released to the App Store in December 2017. Players must repeatedly memorize the order of a randomized collection of nectar, and be able to quickly recall it when the symbols are hidden. The game speeds up with more chains completed, and each level unlocked adds additional bonuses to pursue and dangers to avoid.

Tom Teller
No link I guess, keep Kelly private

Tom Teller the Adventure Speller is a proof-of-concept interactive storytelling experience created as part of an acquaintance's Master's thesis at the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. Written in Swift for iPad, this digital adventure book follows the curious Tom Teller as he explores the jungle, cataloguing every animal he comes across. The player must help Tom identify the creatures he encounters; first giving the name of each animal then identifying some characteristics of each one.

Slim City
Git I guess

Slim City is a fitness-based city builder for iOS. Like any other city sim, you must build buildings, collect resources, and manage your population, only this time your town's productivity is 100% tied to your level of activity. Taking steps in the real world enable your workers to produce resources in the game, so the more active you are on any given day the greater their output when you return. 

Slim City is currently built on Swift using a text-based interface, and with a Realm database backend servicing step data from HealthKit and managing resource collection/usage. Plans are to move Realm to a server where game updates happen synchronously for all players, and to create a grid-based map on which cities can be fully customized.
