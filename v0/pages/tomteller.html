	<h1>Tom Teller the Adventure Speller</h1>
	<p>Tom Teller the Adventure Speller is a proof-of-concept interactive storytelling experience created as part of an acquaintance's Master's thesis at the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. Written in Swift for iPad, this digital adventure book follows the curious Tom Teller as he explores the jungle, cataloguing every animal he comes across. The player must help Tom identify the creatures he encounters; first giving the name of each animal then identifying some characteristics of each one.
