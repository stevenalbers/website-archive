	<p>Slim City is a fitness-based city builder for iOS. Like any other city sim, you must build buildings, collect resources, and manage your population, only this time your town's productivity is 100% tied to your level of activity. Taking steps in the real world enable your workers to produce resources in the game, so the more active you are on any given day the greater their output when you return.</p> 

	<p>Slim City is currently built on Swift using a text-based interface, and with a Realm database backend servicing step data from HealthKit and managing resource collection/usage. Plans are to move Realm to a server where game updates happen synchronously for all players, and to create a grid-based map on which cities can be fully customized.</p>
